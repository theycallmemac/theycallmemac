### Howdy ðŸ¤ 


I write some code now and then, I prefer coffee though. Currently making useful things like [Odin](https://github.com/theycallmemac/odin) and [Stream Local](https://github.com/stream-local). You can also check out my [talks repo](https://github.com/theycallmemac/talks) and [blog](https://jamesmcdermott.ie/post/) for other little bits. 


Soon to start work at AWS. I like to use with Go, Python and Docker. Feel free to hit me up on [Twitter](twitter.com/theycallmemac_)! My pronouns are He/Him.
